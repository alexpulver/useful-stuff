Mike, as CTO, owns the tech vision & roadmap, builds the engineering brand, plans IP, researches new technologies for internal adoption, co-develops product plans with the senior team, leads experimental projects, and helps with senior hires.

As Head of Engineering at Instagram, I oversee team processes, performance, career development, hiring, product delivery, stability, and engineering best practices. I also co-developed the technical strategy with the CTO and worked to ensure its world-class execution.

To further clarify roles, Mike had the great idea of making an example questions routing table:

PM: "I need to get a project staffed" → VPE
EM: "We're about to kick off a new project, and we want to talk architecture" → CTO
EM: "I'm having trouble with a team member" → VPE

Writing out our job descriptions, publishing them, and evangelizing them to the teams clarified our responsibilities and who to go to for what, eliminating most confusion.

Mike knew and understood the differences between these positions. He was passionate about technology and coding, not managing people and standing up processes. So lucky for me, he hired a Head of Engineering to help manage the teams, allowing him to focus on the CTO role.

So before hiring a CTO, consider whether a VP/Head of Eng might be what you need. CTO = top technologist, visionary, researcher. VPE = loves managing people, building teams, hiring, organizational architecture, performance management, career development, and processes.
